 Every day, ***more than 9 billion gallons*** of water are consumed for irrigation in the U.S. alone.
Unfortunately, approximately **50% of water** used in agriculture is wasted due to inefficient irrigation systems.
In fact, water wastage is even common in our neighborhoods and cities.

**E-rrigation is a mobile application that serves as a sprinkler system designer.** It allows users to create sprinkler system designs by plotting land and sprinklers, then it calculates crucial statistics about a given design plan in order to optimize water usage *before* the sprinklers are put into place.

It does this by **eliminating overflowing and repetitive watering** of the same regions.
By providing these statistics, E-rrigation reduces water usage even *before* sprinklers are put into place: cutting down on expenditures in the long run.
