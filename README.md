 Every day, ***more than 9 billion gallons*** of water are used for irrigation in the U.S. of which approximately **50% is wasted** due to inefficient irrigation systems.
In fact, water wastage is even common in our neighborhoods and cities.

**E-rrigation is a mobile application that serves as a sprinkler system designer.** Users create designs by plotting land/sprinklers, and specifying additional info. Then, the app calculates crucial statistics about a given design plan in order to optimize water usage *before* the sprinklers are put into place.

It does this by **eliminating overflowing and repetitive watering** of the same regions.
By providing these statistics, E-rrigation reduces water usage even *before* sprinklers are put into place: cutting down on expenditures in the long run.
