# E-rrigation
Every day, ***more than 9 billion gallons*** of water are consumed for irrigation in the U.S. alone with farming
making up 46% of U.S. land usage.

Unfortunately, approximately **50% of water** used in agriculture is wasted due to inefficient irrigation systems.
In fact, water wastage is even common in our neighborhoods and cities.

**E-rrigation is a mobile application that serves as a sprinkler system designer. It allows users to create sprinkler system designs by plotting land and sprinklers, then calculates statistics about the given design in order to optimize water usage before the sprinklers are put into place.**

By providing these useful statistics, E-rrigation optimizes water usage even before sprinklers are put into place,
thus conserving water and cutting down on expenditures in the long run.
